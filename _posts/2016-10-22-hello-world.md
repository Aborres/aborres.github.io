The intention of this blog is to share and recapitulate all the information that I learn through my way in programming. You can understand this site as a diary of my personal workout or like a series of post about random stuff in programming.

At the time I write this I am in the last course of Computer games in Teesside University and I have already finished a career in Videogames Programming in ESAT (Valencia, Spain). Also, I am currently working in a Spanish company developing technology and games in augmented reality.

As soon as possible I will bring here all the projects I am currently doing and information about the games that I have already done.
